# My-First-Project-on-SQL-Spotify-Data-Analysis-
This is my First SQL project On Spotify Data Analysis  

Spotify SQL Data Analysis Project
This project showcases the application of SQL for analyzing a Spotify dataset, focusing on uncovering trends in music popularity, artist performance, and genre dynamics. By leveraging SQL queries at various levels of complexity—basic, intermediate, and advanced—this project demonstrates how structured query language can extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

Basic Queries:
The project begins with foundational SQL queries to explore and understand the dataset. Key queries include retrieving all data, filtering songs by specific genres or artists, and identifying the top 5 most popular songs. These queries provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset and help establish the foundation for deeper analysis.

Intermediate Queries:
Moving beyond the basics, the project delves into more complex analyses by utilizing SQL aggregation and conditional filtering. For example, queries calculate the average BPM by genre, identify songs with high energy and danceability scores, and track changes in energy and valence levels over the years. These intermediate-level queries provide actionable insights into trends and characteristics within the dataset, such as the most energetic tracks of specific years or songs suitable for live performances.

Advanced Queries:
The advanced level of the project demonstrates proficiency with complex SQL concepts such as JOINS, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and subqueries. For example:

JOINS are used to find collaborations between artists across different songs.
CTEs help streamline complex operations, such as generating reusable query structures for aggregated summaries.
Subqueries are applied to identify unique use cases, such as determining niche genres that appear only once in specific years.
Key Highlights:

Comprehensive SQL query practice, from foundational queries to solving advanced use cases.
Exploration of music trends, including genre popularity, artist performance, and track characteristics.
Real-world application of SQL techniques to analyze and interpret large datasets effectively.
This project serves as a demonstration of SQL skills, offering insights into the power of data-driven storytelling while delivering practical outcomes for analyzing Spotify’s music dataset.
